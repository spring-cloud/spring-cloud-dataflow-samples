==== Using the Cloud Foundry Server

===== Additional Prerequisites

* Cloud Foundry instance

* Running instance of `rabbit` in Cloud Foundry
* Running instance of `mysql` in Cloud Foundry
* A database utility tool such as link:http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/[DBeaver] or link:https://www.dbvis.com/[DbVisualizer]
* Create the `names` table (in MySQL) using:
+
```
CREATE TABLE names
(
	name varchar(255)
);
```
+
* The Spring Cloud Data Flow Cloud Foundry Server

===== Building and Running the Demo

. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-docs/src/main/asciidoc/streams.adoc#register-a-stream-app[Register] the out-of-the-box applications for the Rabbit binder
+
include::{docs_dir}/maven-access.adoc[]
+
```
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/Bacon-RELEASE-stream-applications-rabbit-maven
```
+
. Create the stream
+

```
dataflow:>stream create --name mysqlstream --definition "http | jdbc --tableName=names --columns=name"
Created new stream 'mysqlstream'

dataflow:>stream deploy --name mysqlstream --properties "app.jdbc.spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.services=mysql"
Deployed stream 'mysqlstream'

```
+

NOTE: By supplying  the `app.jdbc.spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.services=mysql` property, we are deploying the stream with `jdbc-sink` to automatically bind to `mysql` service and only this application in the stream gets the service binding. This also eliminates the requirement to supply `datasource` credentials in stream definition.
+
. Verify the stream is successfully deployed
+
```
dataflow:>stream list
```
+
. Notice that `mysqlstream-http` and `mysqlstream-jdbc` https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[Spring Cloud Stream] applications are running as _cloud-native_ (microservice) applications in Cloud Foundry
+

```
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org user-dataflow / space development as user...
OK

name                        requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
mysqlstream-http            started           1/1         1G       1G     mysqlstream-http.app.io
mysqlstream-jdbc            started           1/1         1G       1G     mysqlstream-jdbc.app.io
dataflow-server             started           1/1         1G       1G     dataflow-server.app.io
```
+
. Lookup the `url` for `mysqlstream-http` application from the list above. Post sample data pointing to the `http` endpoint: `<YOUR-mysqlstream-http-APP-URL>`
+
```
http post --contentType 'application/json' --target http://mysqlstream-http.app.io --data "{\"name\": \"Bar"}"
> POST (application/json;charset=UTF-8) http://mysqlstream-http.app.io {"name": "Bar"}
> 202 ACCEPTED
```
+
. Connect to the MySQL instance and query the table `names` to list the new rows:
+
```
select * from names;
```

+
. Now, let's take advantage of Pivotal Cloud Foundry's platform capability. Let's scale the `mysqlstream-http` application from 1 to 3 instances
+
```
$ cf scale mysqlstream-http -i 3
Scaling app mysqlstream-http in org user-dataflow / space development as user...
OK
```
+
. Verify App instances (3/3) running successfully
+
```
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org user-dataflow / space development as user...
OK

name                        requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
mysqlstream-http            started           3/3         1G       1G     mysqlstream-http.app.io
mysqlstream-jdbc            started           1/1         1G       1G     mysqlstream-jdbc.app.io
dataflow-server             started           1/1         1G       1G     dataflow-server.app.io
```
+
. You're done!
