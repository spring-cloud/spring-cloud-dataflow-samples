# Examples for Custom Data Flow Server Build

This is an example for both gradle and maven to build a custom Data Flow Server
adding MySQL driver to a build.

To verify these example builds, you can run `build-and-compare` which will
print differences compared to main releases server jar. If successful you
should see executable jars to differ only with added mysql driver.

```
$ ./test/build-and-compare

Diff gradle build
113a114
> BOOT-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar
Diff maven build
113a114
> BOOT-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar
```
