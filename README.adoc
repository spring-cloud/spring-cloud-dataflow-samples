A simple Spring Batch job running as short-lived task in Cloud Foundry.

## Analytics

### link:analytics/twitter-analytics/README.adoc[twitter-analytics]

A data pipeline demonstration that consumes data from twitter-firehose using `twitterstream` source application and computes simple analytics over data-in-transit with the help of `field-value-counter` sink application.

## Data Science

### link:datascience/species-prediction/README.adoc[species-prediction]

A simple demonstration to walkthrough the steps to compute real-time predictions using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language[PMML] data microservice application.
