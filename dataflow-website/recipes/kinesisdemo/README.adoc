# Spring Cloud Stream and Kinesis Binder in Action

A simple demonstration of a SCSt producer [i.e., `kinesisproducer`] producing random UUID's to Kinesis Streams, which in turn are cosumed by a SCSt consumer [i.e., `kinesisconsumer`] for donwstream processing.

## Notes

Change the following properties in `application.yml` for both the applications.

[source,yaml,options=nowrap,subs=attributes]
----
cloud:
  aws:
    credentials:
      accessKey: 
      secretKey:
    region:
      static: 
    stack:
      auto: false
----

NOTE: You can read more about the credentials and the other applicable properties in link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-aws/spring-cloud-aws.html#_simple_credentials_configuration[Spring Cloud AWS reference guide].

## Build

[source,bash,options=nowrap,subs=attributes]
----
mvn clean -U install
----

## Run

Open two different terminals and start the producer and consumer as follows:

[source,bash,options=nowrap,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar kinesisproducer/target/kinesisproducer-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

java -jar kinesisconsumer/target/kinesisconsumer-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

## Results

If all goes well, you should see something like this in the terminals.
