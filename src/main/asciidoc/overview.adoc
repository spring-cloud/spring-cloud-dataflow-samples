== Monitoring (Micrometer)
Demonstrate how to monitor your  https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/[Spring Cloud Data Flow] (SCDF) streams using  https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/[InfluxDB], https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] and https://grafana.com/grafana[Grafana].

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#streams-monitoring[Data Flow 2.x metrics architecture] is designed around the https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer library] and provides support for two of the most popular monitoring systems, Prometheus and InfluxDB.
Also to help you get started monitoring Streams, Data Flow provides https://grafana.com/[Grafana Dashboards] you can install and customize for your needs.
Support for monitoring Tasks is on the roadmap.

The general architecture of how applications are monitored is shown below.

You can find more information in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#streams-monitoring[SCDF Stream Monitoring] reference manual.

* https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] - pull based time series database used for monitoring of highly dynamic service-oriented architectures.
In a world of microservices, its support for multi-dimensional data collection and querying is a particular strength.
* https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb[InfluxDB] is a popular open-source push based time series database.
It supports downsampling, automatically expiring and deleting unwanted data, as well as backup and restore. Analysis of data is done via a  https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/query_language/[SQL-like query] language.
* https://grafana.com/grafana[Grafana] is open source metrics Dashboard platform. It supports multiple backend time-series databases including InluxDB and Prometheus.
