Tested using

```
$ curl http://localhost:9900 -H "Content-Type:text/plain"   -X POST -D "how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would chuck wood"
```

Only got a blank line in log instance 1 and nothing in log instance 2

```

and
```

Note that something else went wrong using Bacon GA... so docs need to ensure using Celcius or adjust the stream def so it works, I guess something with output types.
