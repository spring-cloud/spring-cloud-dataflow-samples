==== Using the Cloud Foundry Server

===== Additional Prerequisites

* Cloud Foundry instance
* A `rabbit` service instance

* A Running instance of `cassandra` in Cloud Foundry or from another Cloud provider
* A database utility tool such as link:http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/[DBeaver] to connect to the Cassandra instance. You might have to provide `host`, `port`, `username` and `password` depending on the Cassandra configuration you are using.
* Create a `book` table in your Cassandra keyspace using:
+
```
CREATE TABLE book  (
    id          uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    isbn        text,
    author      text,
    title       text
);
```
* The Spring Cloud Data Flow Cloud Foundry Server

===== Building and Running the Demo

. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-docs/src/main/asciidoc/streams.adoc#register-a-stream-app[Register] the out-of-the-box applications for the Rabbit binder
+
include::{docs_dir}/maven-access.adoc[]
+
[subs="attributes"]
```
dataflow:>app import --uri {app-import-rabbit-maven}
```
+
+
. Create the stream
+

```
dataflow:>stream create cassandrastream --definition "http --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType='application/json' | cassandra --ingestQuery='insert into book (id, isbn, title, author) values (uuid(), ?, ?, ?)' --username='<USERNAME>' --password='<PASSWORD>' --port=<PORT> --contact-points=<HOST> --keyspace='<KEYSPACE>'" --deploy

Created and deployed new stream 'cassandrastream'
```

You may want to change the `cassandrastream` name in `PCF` if you have enabled random application name prefix, you could run into issues with the route name being too long.


+
. Verify the stream is successfully deployed
+
```
dataflow:>stream list
```
+
. Notice that `cassandrastream-http` and `cassandrastream-cassandra` https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[Spring Cloud Stream] applications are running as _cloud-native_ (microservice) applications in Cloud Foundry
+

$ cf apps

```
+
. Lookup the `url` for `cassandrastream-http` application from the list above. Post sample data pointing to the `http` endpoint: `<YOUR-cassandrastream-http-APP-URL>`
+
```
http post --contentType 'application/json' --data '{"isbn": "1599869772", "title": "The Art of War", "author": "Sun Tzu"}' --target http://<YOUR-cassandrastream-http-APP-URL>
> POST (application/json;charset=UTF-8) http://cassandrastream-http.app.io {"isbn": "1599869772", "title": "The Art of War", "author": "Sun Tzu"}
> 202 ACCEPTED
```
+
. Connect to the Cassandra instance and query the table `book` to list the data inserted
+
```
select * from book;
```

+
. Now, let's try to take advantage of Pivotal Cloud Foundry's platform capability. Let's scale the `cassandrastream-http` application from 1 to 3 instances
+
```
$ cf scale cassandrastream-http -i 3
Scaling app cassandrastream-http in org user-dataflow / space development as user...
OK
```
+
. Verify App instances (3/3) running successfully
+
```
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org user-dataflow / space development as user...
OK

```
+
. You're done!
