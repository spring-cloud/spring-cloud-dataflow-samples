=== HTTP to Cassandra Demo

In this demonstration, you will learn how to build a data pipeline using http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/[Spring Cloud Data Flow] to consume data from an _HTTP_ endpoint and write the payload to a _Cassandra_ database.

We will take you through the steps to configure and Spring Cloud Data Flow server in either a https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started/[local] or https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started[Cloud Foundry] environment.
