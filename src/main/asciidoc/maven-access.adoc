NOTE: These samples assume that the Data Flow Server can access a remote Maven repository, `https://repo.spring.io/libs-release` by default. If your Data Flow server is running behind a firewall, or you are using a maven proxy preventing
access to public repositories, you will need to install the sample apps in your internal Maven repository and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-maven-configuration[configure]
the server accordingly.  The sample applications are typically registered using Data Flow's bulk import facility. For example, the Shell command `dataflow:>app import --uri {app-import-rabbit-maven}` _(The actual URI is release and binder specific so refer to the sample instructions for the actual URL)_.
The bulk import URI references a plain text file containing entries for all of the publicly available Spring Cloud Stream and Task applications published to `https://repo.spring.io`. For example,
`source.http=maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:http-source-rabbit:1.3.1.RELEASE` registers the `http` source app at the corresponding Maven address, relative to the remote repository(ies) configured for the
Data Flow server. The format is `maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`  You will need to https://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/spring-cloud-stream-app-descriptor/Bacon.RELEASE/spring-cloud-stream-app-descriptor-Bacon.RELEASE.rabbit-apps-maven-repo-url.properties[download] the required apps or https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[build] them and then install them in your Maven repository, using whatever group, artifact, and version you choose. If you do
this, register individual apps using `dataflow:>app register...` using the `maven://` resource URI format corresponding to your installed app.
