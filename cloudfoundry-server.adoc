The Cloud Foundry Data Flow Server is Spring Boot application available for http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/[download] or you can https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry[build] it yourself.
If you build it yourself, the executable jar will be in `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/target`

NOTE: Although you can run the Data Flow Cloud Foundry Server locally and configure it to deploy to any Cloud Foundry space, we will
deploy the server to Cloud Foundry as recommended.
