# Kafka Streams application that joins user click counts and regions

This application has two inputs (user clicks and user regions) and one output (user clicks per region).
Since the Kafka Streams processor has multiple inputs (one for user click events and another one for user regions events), this application needs to be deployed as `app` type and you need to explicitly configure the bindings to the appropriate Kafka topics and other related configurations.


To build this application:

./mvnw clean package

Register this KStream application as `app` type:

```
dataflow:> app register --name join-user-clicks-and-regions --type app --uri file://<local parent directory of this git repo>/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples/kafka-samples/kstreams-join-user-clicks-and-region/target/kstreams-join-user-clicks-and-region-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
