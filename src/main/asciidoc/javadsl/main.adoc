=== Deploying a stream programmaticaly
This sample shows the two usage styles of the Java DSL to create and deploy a stream.
You should look in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples/tree/master/batch/javadsl/src/main[source code] to get a feel for the different styles.

1) Build the sample application

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----
With no command line options, the application will deploy the stream `http --server.port=9900 | splitter --expression=payload.split(' ') | log` using the URI `http://localhost:9393` to connect to the Data Flow server.
There is also a command line option `--style` whose value can be either `definition` or `fluent`.
This options picks which JavaDSL style will execute.
Both are identical in terms of behavior.
The `spring-cloud-dataflow-rest-client` project provides instances of `DataFlowOperations` and  `StreamBuilder` 

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Autowired
private DataFlowOperations dataFlowOperations;

@Autowired
private StreamBuilder builder;
----
You can use those beans to build streams as well as work directly with `DataFlowOperations" REST client.

The `definition` style has code of the style
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
Stream woodchuck = builder
        .name("woodchuck")
        .definition("http --server.port=9900 | splitter --expression=payload.split(' ') | log")
        .create()
        .deploy(deploymentProperties);
----
while the `fluent` style has code of the style
[source,java]
----
Stream woodchuck = builder.name("woodchuck")
        .source(source)
        .processor(processor)
        .sink(sink)
        .create()
        .deploy(deploymentProperties);
----
where `source`, `processor`, and `sink` variables were defined as `@Bean`s of the type `StreamApplication`
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public StreamApplication source() {
  return new StreamApplication("http").addProperty("server.port", 9900);
}
----

Another useful class is the `DeploymentPropertiesBuilder` which aids in the creation of the Map of properties required to deploy stream applications.
[source,java]
----
	private Map<String, String> createDeploymentProperties() {
		DeploymentPropertiesBuilder propertiesBuilder = new DeploymentPropertiesBuilder();
		propertiesBuilder.memory("log", 512);
		propertiesBuilder.count("log",2);
		propertiesBuilder.put("app.splitter.producer.partitionKeyExpression", "payload");
		return propertiesBuilder.build();
	}
----
2) Run a local Data Flow Server and run the sample application.
This sample demonstrates the use of the local Data Flow Server, but you can pass in the option `--uri` to point to another Data Flow server instance that is running elsewhere.
[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/scdfdsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
You will then see the following output.
[source,bash]
----
Deploying stream.
Wating for deployment of stream.
Wating for deployment of stream.
Wating for deployment of stream.
Wating for deployment of stream.
Wating for deployment of stream.
Letting the stream run for 2 minutes.
----
To verify that the application has been deployed successfully, will tail the logs of one of the log sinks and post some data to the http source.
You can find the location for the logs of one of the log sink applications by looking in the Data Flow server's log file.

3) Post some data to the server

```
curl http://localhost:9900 -H "Content-Type:text/plain"   -X POST -d "how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood"
```

5) Verify the output
Tailing the log file of the first instance
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
cd /tmp/spring-cloud-dataflow-4323595028663837160/woodchuck-1511390696355/woodchuck.log
tail -f stdout_0.log
----
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
2017-11-22 18:04:08.631  INFO 26652 --- [r.woodchuck-0-1] log-sink          : how
2017-11-22 18:04:08.632  INFO 26652 --- [r.woodchuck-0-1] log-sink          : chuck
2017-11-22 18:04:08.634  INFO 26652 --- [r.woodchuck-0-1] log-sink          : chuck
----

Tailing the log file of the second instance
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
cd /tmp/spring-cloud-dataflow-4323595028663837160/woodchuck-1511390696355/woodchuck.log
tail -f stdout_1.log
----

You should see the output
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ tail -f stdout_1.log
2017-11-22 18:04:08.636  INFO 26655 --- [r.woodchuck-1-1] log-sink          : much

----
Note that the partitioning is done based on the hash of the `java.lang.String` object.
