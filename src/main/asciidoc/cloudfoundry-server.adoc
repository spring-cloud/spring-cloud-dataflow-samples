The Cloud Foundry Data Flow Server is Spring Boot application available for http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/#platform-implementations/[download] or you can https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry[build] it yourself.
If you build it yourself, the executable jar will be in `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/target`

NOTE: Although you can run the Data Flow Cloud Foundry Server locally and configure it to deploy to any Cloud Foundry instance, we will
deploy the server to Cloud Foundry as recommended.

. Verify that CF instance is reachable (Your endpoint urls will be different from what is shown here).
+

```
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.system.io (API version: ...)

$ cf apps
Getting apps in org [your-org] / space [your-space] as user...
OK

No apps found
```
. Follow the instructions to deploy the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle[Spring Cloud Data Flow Cloud Foundry server]. Don't worry about creating a Redis service. We won't need it. If you are familiar with Cloud Foundry
application manifests, we recommend creating a manifest for the the Data Flow server as shown https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#sample-manifest-template[here].
+
WARNING: As of this writing, there is a typo on the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` entry in the sample manifest. `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` must be followed by `:` and The JSON string must be
wrapped in single quotes. Alternatively, you can replace that line with `MAVEN_REMOTE_REPOSITORIES_REPO1_URL: https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot`.  If your Cloud Foundry installation is behind a firewall, you may need to install the stream apps used in this sample in your internal Maven repository and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/1.3.0.M2/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-maven-configuration[configure] the server to access that repository.
. Once you have successfully executed `cf push`, verify the dataflow server is running
+

```
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org [your-org] / space [your-space] as user...
OK

name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
dataflow-server      started           1/1         1G       1G     dataflow-server.app.io
```

. Notice that the `dataflow-server` application is started and ready for interaction via the url endpoint

. Connect the `shell` with `server` running on Cloud Foundry, e.g., `http://dataflow-server.app.io`
