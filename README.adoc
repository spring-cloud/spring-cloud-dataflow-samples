# Spring Cloud Data Flow Samples

This repository provides various developer tutorials and samples for building applications with Spring Cloud Data Flow. The samples are included in a document available in HTML and PDF.

To build the documents

```
$mvn package
```

The samples include:

## Streaming

* A data pipeline demonstration that consumes data from an `http` endpoint and writes the payload to Cassandra database using the `cassandra` sink application.

* A data pipeline demonstration that consumes data from an `http` endpoint and writes the payload to MySQL database using the `jdbc` sink application.

* Data pipeline demonstrations using GemFire.

## Task / Batch

* A simple Spring Batch job running as short-lived task in Cloud Foundry.

## Functions

* A simple demonstration of Spring Cloud Function and Spring Cloud Data Flow integration.

## Analytics

* A data pipeline demonstration that consumes data from twitter-firehose using `twitterstream` source application and computes simple analytics over data-in-transit with the help of `field-value-counter` sink application.

## Data Science

* A simple demonstration to walkthrough the steps to compute real-time predictions using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language[PMML] application.
