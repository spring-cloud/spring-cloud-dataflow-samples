==== Using the Local Server
===== Additional Prerequisites

* A running local Data Flow Server
include::{docs_dir}/local-server.adoc[]
* A running instance of https://www.rabbitmq.com[Rabbit MQ]

===== Building and Running the Demo

. Use gfsh to start a locator and server
+
```
gfsh>start locator --name=locator1
gfsh>start server --name=server1

```
. Create a region called `Stocks`
+
```
gfsh>create region --name Stocks --type=REPLICATE
```
+
*Use the Shell to create the sample stream*
+
. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-docs/src/main/asciidoc/streams.adoc#register-a-stream-app[Register] the out-of-the-box applications for the Rabbit binder
+
include::{docs_dir}/maven-access.adoc[]
+
```
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/Bacon-RELEASE-stream-applications-rabbit-maven
```
. Create the stream
+
This example creates an http endpoint to which we will post stock prices as a JSON document containing `symbol` and `price` fields.
The property `--json=true` to enable Geode's JSON support and configures the sink to convert JSON String payloads to https://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html[PdxInstance], the recommended way
to store JSON documents in Geode. The `keyExpression` property is a SpEL expression used to extract the `symbol` value the PdxInstance to use as an entry key.
+
NOTE: PDX serialization is very efficient and supports OQL queries without requiring a custom domain class.
Use of custom domain types requires these classes to be in the class path of both the stream apps and the cache server.
For this reason, the use of custom payload types is generally discouraged.
+
```
dataflow:>stream create --name stocks --definition "http --port=9090 | gemfire --json=true --regionName=Stocks --keyExpression=payload.getField('symbol')" --deploy
Created and deployed new stream 'stocks'
```
NOTE: If the Geode locator isn't running on default port on `localhost`, add the options `--connect-type=locator --host-addresses=<host>:<port>`. If there are multiple
locators, you can provide a comma separated list of locator addresses. This is not necessary for the sample but is typical for production environments to enable fail-over.

. Verify the stream is successfully deployed
+
```
dataflow:>stream list
```

. Post sample data pointing to the `http` endpoint: `http://localhost:9090` (`9090` is the `port` we specified for the `http` source)
+
```
dataflow:>http post --target http://localhost:9090 --contentType application/json --data '{"symbol":"VMW","price":117.06}'
> POST (application/json) http://localhost:9090 {"symbol":"VMW","price":117.06}
> 202 ACCEPTED
```
+
. Using `gfsh`, connect to the locator if not already connected, and verify the cache entry was created.
+
```
gfsh>get --key='VMW' --region=/Stocks
Result      : true
Key Class   : java.lang.String
Key         : VMW
Value Class : org.apache.geode.pdx.internal.PdxInstanceImpl

symbol | price
------ | ------
VMW    | 117.06
```
+
. You're done!
